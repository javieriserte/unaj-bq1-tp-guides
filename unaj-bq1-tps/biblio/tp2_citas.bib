   Abstract={A novel nicotinoprotein, catalyzing the dichlorophenolindophenol-dependent oxidation of carveol to carvone, was purified to homogeneity from Rhodococcus erythropolis DCL14. The enzyme is specifically induced after growth on limonene and carveol. Dichlorophenolindophenol-dependent carveol dehydrogenase (CDH) is a homotetramer of 120 kDa with each subunit containing a tightly bound NAD(H) molecule. The enzyme is optimally active at pH 5.5 and 50 degrees C and displays a broad substrate specificity with a preference for substituted cyclohexanols. When incubated with a diastereomeric mixture of (4R)- or (4S)-carveol, CDH stereoselectively catalyzes the conversion of the (6S)-carveol stereoisomers only. Kinetic studies with pure stereoisomers showed that this is due to large differences in V(max)/K(m) values and simultaneous product inhibition by (R)- or (S)-carvone. The R. erythropolis CDH gene (limC) was identified in an operon encoding the enzymes involved in limonene degradation. The CDH nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame of 831 base pairs encoding a 277-amino acid protein with a deduced mass of 29,531 Da. The CDH primary structure shares 10-30% sequence identity with members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. Structure homology modeling with trihydroxynaphthalene reductase from Magnaporthe grisea suggests that CDH from R. erythropolis DCL14 is an alpha/beta one-domain protein with an extra loop insertion involved in NAD binding and a flexible C-terminal part involved in monoterpene binding.}

   Title="{{O}n the interaction of the electron acceptor 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol with bovine milk xanthine oxidase}",

   Abstract={The electron acceptor 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCI) forms a spectrophotometrically and kinetically detectable complex with bovine milk xanthine oxidase. The visible absorption spectrum of complexed DCI exhibits an absorption maximum at 660 nm at pH 7.8 (e = 34.2 x 103 m-1 cm-1), a marked bathochromic shift from the visible absorption maximum at 608 nm characteristic of the free dye (e = 21.0 x 103 m-1 cm-1. The bound dye can be partially removed from the enzyme by prolonged dialysis (24 hours), and totally removed by gel filtration, indicating a reversible rather than a covalent interaction. From the DCI concentration dependence of the spectral change, the stoichiometry of the interaction is 2.08 DCI-binding sites per molecule of xanthine oxidase (assuming a molar extinction coefficient for the enzyme of 66 x 103 m-1 cm-1 at 450 nm); and the dissociation constant of the DCI-enzyme complex is 1.3 x 10-6 m. The spectral shift characteristic of DCI-xanthine oxidase interaction is blocked by 2 mm arsenite, by 2 mm p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, by the competitive inhibitor 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxy-s-triazine, 1.5 mm, and by the "stoichiometric" xanthine oxidase inhibitor, 4,6-dihydroxypyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (4,6-diHPP), at levels equimolar with those of the enzyme. With the latter inhibitor, the DCI spectral shift, although not present initially, develops concomitantly with reoxidation of the reduced enzyme molybdenum of the 4,6-diHPP-xanthine oxidase complex. In contrast to the results seen with the other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, the DCI-xanthine oxidase interaction is not blocked by 16 mm sodium cyanide. In kinetic studies, DCI, in addition to acting as an electron acceptor, is also a noncompetitive inhibitor of the enzyme, with a Ki of 2.8 x 10-6 m. Prior incubation with DCI protects the enzyme from inhibition by arsenite, but not from inhibition by cyanide. On the basis of the spectrophotometric and kinetic data, it is proposed that the DCI-binding site is the molybdenum or molybdenum-sulfur component of the internal electron transport chain of the enzyme. }
